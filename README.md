# Workshare Unemployment Benefits

## Short-time Compensation
Short-time compensation (STC), also referred to as “work share” or “shared work” programs, are active in 26 states. STC is a form of unemployment insurance (UI) that gives employers the option of reducing employees’ hours instead of cutting their workforce during a business slowdown. 

## Opportunity areas to explore
* Currently, 27 states have STC programs established in law that meet the new federal definition with 26 having operational programs.
* Administration of these programs is time-consuming for state employees and employers who, oftentimes, rely on paper processes.
* Most states are trying to heavily-modify COTS software to administer STC, which can lead to high expense, long implementation timelines, and vendor lock-in.
* Awareness of these programs is relatively low and there is federal grant funding available through CARES Act to help improve their awareness/usage.
